The purpose of this file is to read all the extensions in the system and then output them in a
Grandstream Phonebook formatted XML file.

Based of Extensions_to_Yealink_AddressBook in this repository and arielgrin's post int he FreePBX community
https://community.freepbx.org/t/yealink-xml-phonebook-xml-auto-generation/51988/25
